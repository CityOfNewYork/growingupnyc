Keep in mind this should be very specific as you don't want to exercise too much control over user search. Add terms in the format <code>key = Value<\/code> (ex. <code>pre k = Pre-K<\/code>). Include spaces around the <code>=<\/code> operator. <code>key<\/code> is the user input, <code>Value<\/code> is what the term should be. Phrases are respected.\r\n\r\nComparisons are always lower-cased so it doesn't matter if you capitalize the <code>key<\/code>. The <code>Value<\/code> case does matter as it will be preferred as the correct term and replace what the user sees as the search term.",
