== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does ShortPixel compare to other image optimisation plugins (e.g Smush, Imagify, TinyPNG, Kraken, EWWW)?  =
	ShortPixel has better compression rates, more features, supports backups and has very affordable one-time plans.
	If you are serious about making an informed decision please take 10 minutes and read this <a href="https://blog.shortpixel.com/wp-image-optimization-wordpress-plugins/">article</a>.
	
= Can I use the same API Key on multiple web sites? =
    Yes, you can. 
    As long as you have available credits you can use a single API Key on as many websites as you wish!

= Can I test/use the plugin for free? =
    Yes you can. 
    We offer 100 free image optimization credits each month. Exceeding the monthly free quota will pause the optimization process till the quota is reset or extended by buying one of our plans.

= Can I optimize images that aren't in Media Library? =
    Absolutely. 
    You can actually optimize any image you have on your site regardless of its place. You just need to add - in the Advanced section of the ShortPixel Settings - the folders where the images you want to optimize are located and ShortPixel will work its magic and do the rest.

= Can I optimize both past and new images? =
    Sure! 
    You can optimize all your past/current images using our "Bulk ShortPixel" page in your Media with a single click.

= A credit = an optimized image? =
    Yes, that is correct.
     But please note that usually an image in Media Library has 3, 5 or more associated thumbs. Each optimized thumb requires a credit. In the rare cases when ShortPixel does not optimize the image (lossy) with at least 5%, the credit will not be consumed, though.

= Can I restore my images? What happens with the originals? =
    If you choose the "Image backup" option in Settings/ShortPixel then the original version of any optimized image or PDF will be saved in the backup folder.
    The original image is needed if you want to restore an image or if you want to convert an image from lossy/glossy to lossless or viceversa.

= What types of formats can be optimized? =
    ShortPixel optimizes JPEG, PNG, GIF and PDF type of files.

= Do you have one-time plans? =
    Yes we do.
    The credits that come with our <a href="https://shortpixel.com/plans" >one-time plans</a> never expire. Yummy! :-)

= What happens to my existing images? =
    Your existing images are replaced with the optimized ones.
    If you choose the backup option then the originals will be saved in a separate folder so you can restore them should you ever need/want to do that.

= How does the plugin work? =
    Our light-weight plugin sends the original images to our Image Optimization Cloud where they are compressed. ShortPixel then downloads the optimized images and the unoptimized originals are replaced with the optimized versions.

= Do you optimize the images in cloud? =
    Yes, all the images processsed by ShortPixel are optimized in the Cloud. This takes the load off of your server and allows us to produce the best results.

= What payment methods are accepted? =
    We accept payments via PayPal and card.

= How do I activate the API key on a multisite? =
    You have to activate the plugin in the network admin and then activate it manually on each individual site in the multisite. Once you have done that, the Settings menu appears and you can add the API key for each individual site.
    As an alternative, you can edit wp-config.php and add this line
    define(‘SHORTPIXEL_API_KEY’, ‘APIKEY’)
    where ‘APIKEY’ is the API Key received upon sign up.
    If configured that way, the API key will be used for all the sites of the multisite but will only be visible on the main site’s Settings page, being hidden for the rest of the sites.

= I am not the only one working in the WordPress Dashboard. How can I hide my API key? =
    There is a simple way to hide the API key, all you need to do is to add these two lines in your wp-config.php:
    define('SHORTPIXEL_API_KEY', '<<your api key here>>');
    define('SHORTPIXEL_HIDE_API_KEY', true);

= How much is a credit? =
    A credit is used each time ShortPixel optimizes an image or thumbnail by at least 5%. If we're not able to optimize an image or thumbnail by at least 5% then no credit will be used :-)
    Please also note that usually images in your Media Library have 3-5 thumbs associated and a credit will be used for each featured image or associated thumbnail that is optimized.

= Why shall I use a wordpress plugin and not an offline tool? =
    Because ShortPixel algorithms were perfected while optimizing over a hundred million real-life images. 
    ShortPixel not only offers the best compression for JPEG, PNG, GIF and PDF files but it also saves you a lot of time. You just install it on your site and then ShortPixel will take care that all the images on your site are immediately optimized after upload.

= Does optimizing images affect my ALT tags? =
    No, ShortPixel only optimizes images, it won't touch anything else like your HTML/CSS.

= If I stop using ShortPixel will my images remain optimized? =
    Absolutely!
    Once optimized the images will remain optimized unless you explicitly choose to restore them. But why would you do that? :-)

= Do I have to pay monthly or one time? =
    We have both options available. 
    One-time credits never expire are a bit more expensive. Check out our prices <a href="https://shortpixel.com/pricing" >here</a>

= When can I cancel a monthly plan? =
    Whenever you want. 
    The credits you still have available for the current billing period will still be available until the end of the billing period. At the end of it, you won't be billed again and the plan will be reset to the free plan.

= When credits expire? =
    Monthly credits expire after 30 days while one-time credits never expire.

= Do you have an API? =
    Yes, we have several APIs and tools. 
    You can learn more about it here:
    <a href="https://shortpixel.com/api-tools">https://shortpixel.com/api-tools</a>

= Can I use ShortPixel WP plugin on a localhost installation? =
    Unfortunately not :-(
    But you can use either our command line tool or our web tool
    <a href="https://shortpixel.com/web-tool-docs">https://shortpixel.com/web-tool-docs</a>
    <a href="https://shortpixel.com/cli-docs">https://shortpixel.com/cli-docs</a>

= How does resizing work? =
    If you choose the option to resize your images then the featured image can be resized to a predefined size while keeping its aspect and proportions intact. The associated thumbs won't be resized
    Using this option you can safely upload original images safely without needing to apply any pre-processing to make them smaller.

= Will ShortPixel work if my website is using CloudFare? =
    Absolutely! Sometimes you'll need to make sure you whitelist some IPs, just <a href="http://shortpixel.com/contact">contact us</a> and we'll assist you with that.

= I’m stuck. What do I do? =
